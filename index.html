                <h2>Topic 1: Printing to the console in Pyhton</h2>
                <p>we're ready to start learning how to program.

                    Now, remember that the whole reason why we're learning to program is to be able to tell the computer

                    what it needs to do, and for it to follow our commands.

                    So let's go ahead and tell the computer to do something.

                    And we're going to do that by writing our first line of code.

                    So in this case I'm creating something called a print function, which is just the word print all in

                    lowercase and then followed by a set of parentheses.

                    Now inside these parentheses I'm going to tell it what I want it to print.

                    And hopefully it's going to output that inside our console.

                    So I'm going to start off by writing the classic Hello World inside here.

                    And then once you're ready then go ahead and click run.

                    After a few seconds you should see the computer follow your command, namely printing the words that

                    you told it to print inside the console or the output area over here.

                    And once it's done, it indicates that by writing process finished with exit code zero, which means

                    everything was successful, everything was run without any issues.

                    Now, just to break down this area a little bit more for you, if you look at the top line here, which

                    you'll always, always see, there's a lot of text in here, but it's actually very simple to
                    understand.

                    Essentially it's telling you the location of the current file that is being run that has resulted in

                    this output.

                    So in our case, it's the day one task.

                    And you'll see this change as you go through the different days.

                    Because the location of this file where you wrote the code will change.

                    So the first line is the location of the file that you executed.

                    The second line, or multiple lines in between, is the result of your command to the computer.

                    And then finally at the very, very end, it tells you if the process finished with success, which

                    is in this case, or if there are any other issues, it would show up here as well, which we're going

                    to see very, very shortly.

                    And to be sure that you're always running the current file, make sure that this drop down is
                    selected

                    as current file.

                    And that way, every time you press the play button here, it will run the code into the output area.

                    Now if you want to do a shortcut and you're really into keyboard shortcuts, you can hover over the

                    play button and you'll see the shortcut on what I'm using, which is a mac is Control Plus R in
                    Windows

                    or Linux.

                    It'll show up different shortcuts, but it should all show up there if you want to try that out.

                    Alternatively, just keep pressing the play button and it works just as well.

                    And the way that this command works is super simple.

                    You have the keyword print followed by a set of parentheses, and then inside the parentheses, you

                    tell it what you want it to print.

                    And once you've inserted that, then when this line of code gets executed by the computer, it'll know

                    to simply print or output the thing that you've placed in between the parentheses.

                    But notice here that it's not just the word hello world exclamation mark that I've put inside my
                    parentheses.

                    I've also added some quotation marks or double quotes around the word.

                    And the reason why I've done this is so that I can tell the computer that this bit here, in between

                    the double quotes, is not code.

                    It's not like print where it's supposed to do something.

                    This is just some text that I've made up that I want it to print out.

                    And these pieces of text in programming lingo, is known as strings.

                    And you can imagine it as almost like a pearl necklace.

                    Right?

                    It's a string of characters.

                    And what the double quotes do is they basically show the beginning and the end of that string of
                    characters.

                    So that means you have to be really careful when you're typing.

                    For example, if I go ahead and I miss out the closing double quote, well, now you can see that
                    there's

                    some changes that have happened to our code already, namely that the last parentheses, instead of

                    being colored and white like the opening parentheses or how it used to be, it's now colored in
                    green,

                    the same color as the rest of our text or our string.

                    And this is a subtle hint to us.

                    You're going to get really attuned to these subtle hints, because they are the clues that will tell

                    you what might have gone wrong in your code.

                    If I run this code as it is right now, it's going to break.

                    It's going to give me a syntax error, and it says something that seems like it's completely not
                    English.

                    So how can we figure out what this means?

                    Now, the thing I want you to know is that all programmers make mistakes.

                    We all make lots of errors, like forgetting to add the double quotes at the end of the string, or

                    forgetting to add a closing parentheses.

                    These things are just common errors because we're human.

                    But the thing that differentiates great programmers is we're really good at figuring out what the
                    problem

                    is and how to fix it.

                    So you can imagine that coding is just a whole bunch of problems that you have to solve.

                    And in this case, when we get some sort of red text and our code is not doing what we expected to
                    do,

                    then all we have to do is take this entire error message where it says something, something error,

                    and this is some sort of message that we're supposed to understand, and we're simply going to drop

                    it into Google.

                    And usually the first link you come across will be from a website called Stackoverflow.com.

                    And this is basically the Q&A website that all developers will go to whenever something is wrong
                    with

                    their code, or when they can't figure out how to do something.

                    So if we click on this link, you can see that somebody else has also had this error.

                    And some kind souls have told us that the solution might be the fact that you're missing a double
                    quote

                    before the end of the line.

                    So if we take a look back at our code, the code that generated this error looks like this.

                    And indeed, we are missing a double quote at the end of our string.

                    As you're learning to code, as you're going through your 100 days, I want you to become more and
                    more

                    attuned to the color of your code, because one of the most helpful things that code editors such as

                    this do for us is something called syntax highlighting.

                    For example, when I was missing that double quote, it highlighted this entire thing and that is
                    basically

                    it telling us, it seems like this whole thing is some text.

                    It thinks that all of this is a string and that we're missing a closing parenthesis.

                    So if you notice this and you're like, wait, actually that's not right.

                    This part should match the color of the open brace, which is white.

                    So there must be something wrong here.

                    And indeed, if you have a look at the error message, it actually has a little carrot sign right here

                    showing you that there's something that's probably not right here.

                    And it might jog your memory that, oh yeah, I've forgotten a closing double quote.

                    Now, the really handy thing about PyCharm is it actually underlines your errors before you even run

                    your code.

                    And if you hover over the underline, it usually gives you some intelligent guess as to what your
                    problem

                    might be.

                    And in this case, it's absolutely spot on.

                    It says you're missing a closing quote, which is exactly what we're missing.

                    So that will also be really helpful for us to figure out what it is that we need to do.

                    But as with all things with AI, if we don't know what we're doing in the first place, these hints

                    don't help us that much.

                    For example, if I put the closing quote right here, I've got other problems and I'm going to create

                    more problems for myself.

                    So it's important that we first understand how things work and then use technology and AI to help
                    us,

                    such as in this case, to fix our bug.

                    Now, you'll notice that there is also a tiny squiggly line under this closing brace, but in this
                    case,

                    it's not in red, so it's not an error, but instead it's in yellow, which is a warning.

                    Now, most of these warnings come from a good standard practice for how to write code.

                    And if we hover over this warning, it tells us that Pep eight, which is guidance for how to write

                    Python code, and it tells you that the problem that it's seeing is there's no new line at the end of

                    the file.

                    Now, we can ignore all of this because it's a bit too complicated, and it's actually very simple to

                    solve this problem.

                    All it's saying is that in good practice when we're writing Python code, there should be a new line

                    at the end of the file so that we have our cursor down here instead of ending right there.

                    And that's all there is to it.

                    And with that one thing, we've gotten rid of all our errors.

                    We've gotten rid of all our warnings.

                    Our code looks good stylistically as well as syntactically.

                    All these big words that all it means is that it looks great in every single way.

                    And we've got our little check mark, which means no problems found by the editor.

                    Now, sometimes the editor can be really picky, and some of the things that it tells you you can
                    safely

                    ignore.

                    But as always, we need to understand how everything works before we can do that.

                    So now that we've embarked on our first step to write some code and start commanding the computer to

                    do what we wanted to do, which is to print out some words into the output area.

                    It's now time for a challenge.

                    So head over to the next lesson, and we're going to test you on what you've learned in this lesson

                    by practicing writing some print statements.

                    So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="topic2" class="note">
                <h2>Topic 2: String Manipulation</h2>
                <p>All right, guys, let's get back to learning about a few more things that we can do with strings.

                    You saw in the last lesson that if we wanted to print things on individual lines, then we actually

                    had to write them a few times, right?

                    We had to write print, um, on three lines if we wanted it to be printed one, two, three.

                    Like so.

                    Now in this lesson, I want to show you a method where we can do the same thing, but by using a
                    single

                    print method, so saving ourselves a few characters.

                    So the way that we would create a new line is by writing a backslash and the n character.

                    And now if I go ahead and write Hello World again afterwards, and I hit run, and you can see that

                    once that line of code has been executed, I've got Hello World printed on two separate lines
                    separated

                    by this backslash n character, which gets replaced by a new line.

                    So go ahead and give that a go and see if you can create another one.

                    Remember though, it's a backslash and not a forward slash.

                    But the syntax highlighting should help you.

                    All right.

                    We can simply just add another backslash n and remember that unless you want a space to appear right

                    before where your hello world appears, you actually don't want any gaps between each of these lines.

                    There we go.

                    We've got the same result as before, but now using only a single print statement and creating some

                    new lines with the backslash n.

                    Now, one of the other things that we can do with strings is we can concatenate them.

                    What this means is we combine different strings so that there will be added to the end of another
                    string.

                    Here's an example.

                    Let's say that we had the word hello, and I wanted to add my name to the end of this word to make it

                    a single string.

                    Well, I can combine two strings by simply using a plus sign so I can write hello plus Angela.

                    Now here's a question.

                    When this runs, what do you think it will look like?

                    Do you think it'll write hello space Angela or hello Angela?

                    All in one word.

                    Let's see what happens.

                    You can see that these two strings have now been combined into one, and there's no space in between

                    because we don't have a space character anywhere in here.

                    Pause the video and see if you can add a space in between.

                    All right.

                    So there's two ways that you can do this.

                    Well maybe three actually you could add a space to the end of hello.

                    You could add a space to the beginning of Angela, or you can actually continue using string
                    concatenation

                    by simply adding another string in between these two.

                    And this one is just a space.

                    So now when I run my code you can see the space gets inserted and this long thing gets combined into

                    a single string that looks like this.

                    Once this bit of the code gets executed, if we think of strings as a string of connected characters,

                    then string concatenation is simply taking those separate strings of characters and merging them
                    into

                    one.

                    Now, this is a good point to mention that in Python, programming spaces are really, really
                    important.

                    And what I mean by this is not so much the spaces that are inside strings like this one, but the
                    spaces

                    that you add in your code.

                    So here you can see that the print statement starts at the very beginning of this line two.

                    But what happens if I add a space before the print statement?

                    Now you can see I've got the editor screaming at me already.

                    I've got errors, I've got squiggly lines, and if I run this code as it is, I'll get something that's

                    called an indentation error.

                    Now this is different to the previous error we had which was a syntax error.

                    Now what this error tells you is that there is an unexpected indent around this part of your code.

                    That's what the error message is telling me.

                    So we can then go and investigate and see our squiggly lines and we can hopefully realize that,
                    oops,

                    we've added an extra space which we can easily get rid of, and it will calm everything down and get

                    rid of that error.

                    So remember, previously we were missing a closing quotation mark and we got a syntax error.

                    And in this case we have a indentation error by either adding in an aberrant space or accidentally
                    inserting

                    even a whole tab which is created using the tab key.

                    And all of these things will give you indentation errors.

                    So it's really important that you be careful when you're adding spaces in your Python code.

                    It doesn't matter so much when we have spaces in between the quotation marks, because that's a part

                    of the string, but anywhere that is a part of the code.

                    So in this case, anything that's not green and you go ahead and add some spaces, you might end up

                    with an indentation error.

                    Now you might also when you add spaces in your code, not have an indentation error because the code

                    can function.

                    For example, if I add a space between print and the parentheses.

                    But in this case nothing really changes in terms of our output.

                    But we do get a warning because this is not really ideally how we should format our code.

                    So our warning tells us that according to pep8 and best practices, there shouldn't be whitespace
                    before

                    an open parenthesis.

                    So we can also use that hint to get rid of any of these issues.

                    So the message here is be careful when you're adding spaces.

                    Make sure you know what it's doing.

                    And when you see the error indentation error.

                    Remember what you learned in this lesson to be able to fix it Now, as helpful as these warnings and

                    errors are, you'll notice that I'm putting a lot of emphasis on looking at the errors that come out

                    after we hit run.

                    And that's because this comes from the Python compiler itself.

                    This will be the same whenever you write Python code.

                    However, these squiggly lines and these errors that you get when you hover over them are specific to

                    the editor that we're using here, which is PyCharm.

                    Now, if you happen to be using a different type of editor, they might not give you the same kind of

                    warnings, and they might not give you the same kind of errors.

                    And the messages will also be wildly different.

                    So it's always really important to learn the errors that you get back after you run your code.

                    And to remember these words syntax error or indentation error.

                    And this is something that will help you no matter what tools you use, making you a more flexible
                    developer.

                    And we're going to see this in practice right now because I've got a debugging exercise coming up
                    for

                    you right after this lesson, and we're going to be doing it inside a different editor without the
                    assistance

                    of all of these helpful squiggly lines.

                    So can you rely on your skills, your ability to debug when you run your code and see error messages

                    and go through each of the lines of the debugging exercise one by one, and fix each problem from top

                    to bottom.

                    This word debugging actually comes from a story where back in the 80s, a moth actually flew into one

                    of the early computers and it got electrocuted.

                    Unfortunately for the moth and for the programmer, it meant that his code wasn't performing as he
                    would

                    expect it to, so he actually had to go into the computer, pick out the moth and fix the wires so
                    that

                    it would work again.

                    Now, we don't have any moths flying around in our code, thankfully, but what we do have to do is

                    we have to pick out the errors so that our code will run in the way that we expect it to without any

                    errors.

                    So head over to the next lesson and try out your first debugging exercise.</p>

                <h2>Topic 3: Python Input Function</h2>
                <p>And today I want to talk about a different function.

                    So we've seen the print function and all the things that we can do to strings and use the print
                    function

                    and debug it.

                    But what if we wanted to be able to enter some data.

                    So if we wanted to say, ask the user what is your name?

                    And we run this code, you can see that being printed, but there's no way for the user on this side

                    to be able to give our code some data to work with.

                    In order to do that, instead of using the print function, we're going to use a different function,

                    and it's called the input function.

                    And notice how as I'm typing code intelligence is already giving me some suggestions because it
                    thinks

                    it knows what I might want and it's right.

                    So this is what the input function looks like.

                    This is the name of the function.

                    And again it's followed by some parentheses.

                    Inside the parentheses is the prompt that I'm going to give the user.

                    So when I run this code, it will say, what is your name?

                    Now this time you'll notice a couple of differences.

                    Firstly, it doesn't have that final line process finished with exit code zero.

                    It's actually not saying anything at all.

                    Plus, when you look up here, you'll see that in addition to the play button, there's the stop button

                    being highlighted and the play button.

                    It has changed this rerun symbol.

                    So what is all of this mean?

                    Well, it means that we're actually in the middle of the process of running our code.

                    It hasn't exited yet.

                    And what exactly is it waiting for?

                    Well, it's waiting for us to click into this output pane and actually type in an input.

                    So the prompt is the text that goes into the input command.

                    And then afterwards we can add some actual input whatever it is we want into the output area.

                    And now once I hit enter you'll see that finally we have the process finished with exit code.

                    You'll see the stop button is gone.

                    And we can now rerun the code as usual.

                    But where did this text go and how can we capture it?

                    The input function looks pretty much identical to the print function, but instead of the word print,

                    it's just got the word input and inside the parentheses.

                    Instead of adding what text will be printed, we're adding the prompt for the user to give them a
                    hint

                    as to what kind of data we want.

                    And then when you run this code, it will print out the prompt, but then there will be a cursor.

                    In some places you'll see it like a flashing cursor, other places it'll just be a solid cursor.

                    And in some places you won't even see a cursor until you click into the output area ready for the
                    user

                    to type in some piece of data.

                    So what can we do with this data?

                    Well, we can use it inside our code.

                    Now the way that this works is when this line is run by the computer, it takes your command as
                    understanding

                    that you want the user.

                    So somebody to be able to you want the user to be able to type in an input into this area and
                    whatever

                    it is they type, you're going to take it back into the code and replace this command with it.

                    So this is a little bit abstract when we see it like this.

                    But let's imagine we wanted to write a print statement and we wanted to say hello.

                    And we wanted to greet the user.

                    Now I know that in my case my name is Angela.

                    So I would get it to say hello Angela.

                    But what if you didn't know the name of your user?

                    Well, you wouldn't just want to say hello user or hello something generic.

                    You would want them to be able to type in their name.

                    So this is where a little bit of string concatenation comes in, which we learned before.

                    If we take this input function that we've explored just now and we paste it into this print
                    statement.

                    So this can be a little bit confusing.

                    So just concentrate right here.

                    There's two parentheses at the end.

                    And the reason for this is because this first one closes off the print statement.

                    So we're saying everything between here and here we want it to be printed.

                    Now what is in between there.

                    Well firstly it's the string that says hello and then a space.

                    and then what we had as the input.

                    So whatever the user types into here will replace this highlighted part and we'll end up with hello

                    concatenate.

                    So add to another string.

                    So let's try this out.

                    Let's go ahead and hit run.

                    And you can see the prompt show up in the output area.

                    So now if I click into this area, my cursor starts flashing and I can type whatever it is I want.

                    Now when I hit enter, what I type is going to go and replace this input function.

                    And then once it's in there, the print function is going to carry out its role and it's going to add

                    the word hello in front of it and then print it out right here so we can see now.

                    Hello Angela.

                    But this is of course making our code a lot more adaptable.

                    So if tomorrow I decided to change my name to, uh, cherry.

                    There's a really embarrassing story about this.

                    So when I first moved to the UK, I wanted to pick my own name because I was nine years old and I
                    wanted

                    a very, uh, fruit related name.

                    Um, and this was the name that I wanted.

                    And my parents, as as wise as they are, said, no, we will take your name.

                    So that's how I ended up with the name Angela.

                    So now you can see this gets added in to the hello.

                    And we can have a completely adaptable bit of code.

                    So now it's time for a small challenge.

                    Can you use what you've learned from previous lessons, and also this lesson to figure out how to add

                    a exclamation mark to the end of the sentence that's being printed.

                    So instead of just hello Angela, we want the output to say hello.

                    And then we take in whatever it is user inputs into here, and then we replace that with the user
                    input.

                    And finally we add an exclamation mark.

                    Now of course we have to do this using strings and using what we've learned about Python code.

                    So pause the video, read the description of the problem and see if you can solve it.

                    Okay, so if you remember from string concatenation what we need to do is we need to treat this input

                    function as its own string, because eventually it's going to be replaced by a string.

                    So we can take that part, set it aside.

                    And then we can use the plus sign to concatenate the final character, which is a exclamation mark to

                    this entire long string.

                    So now if I go ahead and run this code and I type in an input, that input gets inserted and replaces

                    this entire input function.

                    And then finally I get the exclamation mark added to the end.

                    If you find this line of code difficult to understand and to wrap your head around, then I recommend

                    heading over to a website called thonny.

                    Org and downloading an application called Thonny.

                    It's completely free and it's available for windows, Mac and Linux.

                    And once you've installed this application, you can go ahead and paste your line of code here and
                    click

                    on this little debug symbol.

                    And then we can click on this button, which is called the step into button.

                    To step into the execution of this line of code to see how the computer is evaluating this code
                    here,

                    step by step.

                    So you'll see the first thing it tries to do is it will try to run this print statement.

                    It looks inside these parentheses to see what it needs to print.

                    So the first thing is this hello.

                    And it turns that into a string.

                    And then it looks at the next thing after the plus sign to see what it should turn this into.

                    And this of course is the input function.

                    So as I continue stepping into it, it's actually going to execute it.

                    So it's going to run this input function and show the prompt.

                    What is your name.

                    So that's what shows up down here.

                    And now if I enter a value in here and hit enter, then that value that I put right there replaces
                    that

                    previous input function and is now held inside the print statement.

                    So if I continue stepping through this code, then you'll see it concatenates all of the pieces
                    together.

                    And finally it just ends up with a simple print.

                    Hello, Angela, exclamation mark.

                    And if I continue stepping into it, you'll see that line of code executed until there are no more
                    instructions

                    left.

                    So if you prefer seeing your code, um, run like this step by step so that you can see what's going

                    on, then I recommend giving this a go.

                    As you're learning to code, there's going to be new concepts covered.

                    There's going to be things that take a little bit of thinking before you can understand it.

                    So what a lot of programmers love to do is they like to comment in their code.

                    Now, you might have seen this already throughout the coding exercises and the solutions I provided,

                    but in Python, if you wanted a line of text to not be considered by the computer at all, all you
                    have

                    to do is add the hashtag or pound sign in front of your text, and this turns it into a comment.

                    So something that the computer will completely ignore.

                    So in here you can write code as much as you like.

                    Um, but it won't be executed.

                    And when you click run, you'll see that this is completely ignored.

                    So what I recommend is whenever you come across a new concept in the course, to make a comment above

                    it so that you can explain to yourself what's actually going on in the line of code below.

                    This way, the next time you come across this line of code and you're not quite sure what's actually

                    happening here, you can have a look at the notes that you've written for yourself in your own words,

                    and hopefully it'll jog your memory and make it much easier to comprehend what's going on.

                    In addition to adding a pound sign manually, you can also highlight a line of code or simply have
                    your

                    cursor on a line of code and hold down command and forward slash if you're on Mac or control and
                    forward

                    slash if you're on windows.

                    And what this does is it takes this line of code out of the computer's awareness, and it's no longer

                    executed when you run this code file.

                    So the process is finished without anything being carried out at all, because all the computer is
                    seeing

                    is a blank page because we've taken all the code out into comments.

                    So in order to take this back into code, all you have to do is use the same command that you tried

                    just now.

                    So command forward slash on Mac or control forward slash on windows.

                    And this will now again be considered as code by the computer.

                    All right.

                    So in this lesson we learned about the input function.

                    We learned about putting functions inside other functions and being able to get user input from the

                    console by using the input function.</p>
